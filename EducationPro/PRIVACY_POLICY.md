## EducationPro: Privacy policy

Welcome to the EducationPro app for Android!

This is an Android app developed by Wasim Akhtar. The app is also available on Google Play.

As an avid Android user myself, I take privacy very seriously.
I know how irritating it is when apps collect your data without your knowledge.

I hereby state, to the best of my knowledge and belief, that I have not programmed this app to collect any personally identifiable information. 

### Explanation of permissions requested in the app

The list of permissions required by the app can be found in the `AndroidManifest.xml` file:



<br/>

| Permission | Why it is required |
| :---: | --- |
| `android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE` | This is required to use Database Functionality. |
| `android.permission.INTERNET` | Required to CRUD operation |
| `com.google.android.gms.permission.AD_ID` | Enables the app show the adsend. |

If you find any security vulnerability that has been inadvertently caused by me, or have any question regarding how the app protectes your privacy, please send me an email or post a discussion on GitHub, and I will surely try to fix it/help you.

Yours sincerely,  
Wasim Akhtar.
